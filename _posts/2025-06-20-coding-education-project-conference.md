Ryo Yanagida from the group hosted the ["Coding, Creativity, and Confidence in the 
Generative AI-Era Conference"](https://ccc-ai-era.github.io/events/2025-06-conference) along with the other project members. 
The team included Anna Sollazzo from the School. 

Coding, Creativity, and Confidence in AI-Era project was funded by Glasgow Crucible 
seed-fund. In the past year, the team ran the ["Have your say! â€” Coding Education and AI" Event](% link _posts/2024-09-13-coding-education-event.md %), 
and since then, they conducted interviews and interventions to the students across the College of Engineering and Science.

The conference gathered researchers across the University with interest in coding
education and impact of Generative-AI. The team presented the project, method,
and the initial observations. Maria Kallia from the School presented a 
talk as one of the four invited speakers.

Elizabeth Boswell from the group also attended and contributed to the group discussion, 
providing her perspective as one of the demonstrator in Computing Science courses.
