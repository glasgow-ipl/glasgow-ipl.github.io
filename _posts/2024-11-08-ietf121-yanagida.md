I attended the [IETF 121](https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/121/proceedings)
meeting in Dublin earlier this month.

Throughout the week, I attended a range of sessions, and engaged with both 
the industry community as well as the academics attending the IETF. 
I gave a talk about the [sodestream project](https://sodestream.github.io) at the IRTF [Research and Analysis 
of Standard-Setting Processes Research Group (Rasprg)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/rasprg/about/) meeting session.
The main focus of the talk was to present the data collection and analysis workflow 
developed through the project.

Through the discussions in the meeting sessions, I gained useful suggestions and 
potential directions to explore. Personally, I found the experience of both 
presenting and engaging with the community incredibly useful.

Prior to the IETF meetings, IETF Hackathon was held on 2nd and 3rd November. 
Similarly to the [prior IETF Hackathon](https://ilnp.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk//freebsd/20231105-ietf118_hackathon/), I joined Saleem Bhatti from 
the University of St Andrews to test and demonstrate [Identifier Locator Network Protocol (ILNP)](https://ilnp.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk//). 
We carried out some data collection and debugging of the code, continue to move the project forward.
