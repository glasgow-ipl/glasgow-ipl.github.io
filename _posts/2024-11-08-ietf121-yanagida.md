Ryo Yanagida attended the [IETF 121](https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/121/proceedings)
meeting in Dublin earlier this month.

Throughout the week, Ryo attended a range of sessions, and engaged with both 
the industry community as well as the academics attending the IETF. 
He gave a talk about the [sodestream project](https://sodestream.github.io) at the IRTF [Research and Analysis 
of Standard-Setting Processes Research Group (Rasprg)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/rasprg/about/) meeting session.
The main focus of the talk was to present the data collection and analysis workflow 
developed through the project. 

Through the discussions in the meeting sessions, we gained useful suggestions and 
potential directions to explore. Personally, I found the experience of both 
presenting and engaging with the community incredibly useful.

Prior to the IETF meetings, IETF Hackathon was held on 2nd and 3rd November. 
Similarly to the [prior IETF Hackerthon](https://ilnp.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk//freebsd/20231105-ietf118_hackathon/), Ryo joined Saleem Bhatti from 
the University of St Andrews to test and demonstrate [Identifier Locator Network Protocol (ILNP)](https://ilnp.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk//). 
We carried out some data collection and debugging of the code, continue to move the project forward.
