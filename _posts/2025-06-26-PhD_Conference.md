Ryo Yanagida and Yuting Wan from the group attended the Sicsa PhD Conference 2025, which took place at the Edinburgh Napier University on June 25th and June 26th.

Yuting contributed to "Reverse Viva" session as the examiner, which took place on the first day. Reverse Viva is designed to help PhD students experience and to 
help them better understand the process of UK viva by being on the 'other-side'. 
On the second day, Ryo hosted the workshop "Bridging the Nerdy Abyss: How Systems Research Meets the Rest of the CS interdisciplinary research" along with [Paul Harvey](https://www.paul-harvey.org) from the School. 
This workshop aims to help CS researchers outside of systems to explore a potential systems research perspective in their research. 
The session was designed by the former member of the group [Stephen McQuistin](https://www.smcquistin.uk) at the University of St Andrews, who is one of the [Sicsa's Systems and Software Engineering theme](https://sicsa.ac.uk/research/themes/systems-software-engineering/) lead.
