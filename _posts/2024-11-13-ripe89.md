*Choose wisely...*


Recently, Elizabeth Boswell from the group attended [RIPE89](https://ripe89.ripe.net) in Prague. This trip was generously funded by RIPE through the [RIPE Labs article competition](https://labs.ripe.net/competitions/ripe-labs-article-competition-ripe-88/). 
There were many interesting presentations on wide-ranging topics such as [Residential Proxies](https://ripe89.ripe.net/archives/video/1446/), [extended DNS errors](https://ripe89.ripe.net/archives/video/1468/), [phishing](https://ripe89.ripe.net/archives/video/1430/) and [blocking/censorship](https://ripe89.ripe.net/archives/video/1496/). Additionally, it was a great opportunity to make connections with people from industry and academia. 

Thanks again to RIPE for funding this trip!
